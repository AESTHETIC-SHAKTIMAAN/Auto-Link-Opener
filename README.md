# Auto-Link-Opener
A simple Batch program that opens your saved links on every PC start. 

##Usage
- Run the `setup.bat` file
- This will setup the required things
- Then the program will ask you to enter the links
- You can enter upto 2 links
- The links will be saved on your PC itself.
- If configured successfully the program will open the Links whenever the pc goes a restart
- Antivirus can intefere with the program

##Points to Remember

- Replace `https://` and `http://` with `www.` as the program recognises entries with `www.` as links otherwise the program will open a terminal with the Link as title
- This program may not work in some Pcs ( works fin in mine).
- As the name of user is different in each Pc i have used the `%userprofile%` variable
- If the `%userprofile%` variable does not exist the program may cause errors as most of it depends on the variable
